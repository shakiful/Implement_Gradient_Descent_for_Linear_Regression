Explanation of Results 

Both the closed-form solution (Normal Equation) and the Gradient Descent algorithm produced nearly identical results for the intercept and slope. The Gradient Descent algorithm successfully 

converged to the same optimal solution as the analytical closed-form method, which is the expected outcome.  The loss curve plot clearly shows the Mean Squared Error decreasing rapidly in the initial iterations before stabilizing, indicating that the model was learning effectively.
